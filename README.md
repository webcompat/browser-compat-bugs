# Browser Compat Bugs

Repository for web developers to report browser compatibility issues.

The goal is to help web developers to report issues with a test case illustrating the issue at hand, so that browser implementers can have a look at it.

## Example Issue

To get an idea of what kind of issues to report, here is an example:

* [CSS multi-column and SVG renders differently in Chrome compared to Safari and Firefox](https://github.com/webcompat/browser-compat-bugs/issues/5)

## Browser Compat Bugs vs webcompat.com

The site [webcompat.com](https://webcompat.com/) collects issues reported by users when they have the feeling the website is broken in one browser but not another. The bugs are collected into [web-bugs](https://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues). 

This repo is here to collect specific test cases illustrating the difference between two or more browsers. The bar for contributing an issue is higher.

## Future

Eventually this repo could be hooked into browser DevTools to automatically submit a reduced test case. We are not there yet. Let's start simple.
