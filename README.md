# webdev

Repository for web developers to report browser compatibility issues.

The goal is to help web developers to report issues with a test case illustrating the issue at hand, so that browser implementers can have a look at it.

## Webdev vs webcompat.com

The site [webcompat.com](https://webcompat.com/) collects issues reported by users when they have the feeling the website is broken in one browser but not another. The bugs are collected into [web-bugs](https://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues). 

This repo is here to collect specific test cases illustrating breakage with test cases illustrating the difference in between two or more browsers. The bar for contributing an issue is higher.

## Future

Eventually this repo could be hooked into browser DevTools to automatically submit a reduced test case. We are not there yet. Let's start simple.
